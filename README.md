Simple Spreadsheet

This program is a basic spreadsheet application written in Java. It allows you to perform calculations, use formulas, and manage data in a grid of cells.

What You Can Do

	•	Perform Calculations: Enter simple math like =2+3 or =10/5 directly into a cell.
	•	Use Formulas: Refer to other cells in your formulas (e.g., =A1+B2).
	•	Handle Division by Zero: If you divide by zero (e.g., =10/0), the result will be "Infinity".
	•	Work with Data: Load and save your spreadsheet to a file.
Why Use It?

This program is perfect for small, simple calculations and learning how spreadsheets work. It’s like a mini version of Excel but focused on basic functionality!
